    <h1>Co-op jobs vs summer jobs</h1>

    <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595049822012-0a2fd6707ae0?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MXx8c3VtbWVyJTIwam9ifGVufDB8fDB8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=60" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #68C8CA; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
    <p>
        Many students have had some kind of ‘job’ - tutoring, retail, fast food, volunteering in some community setting, coaching, camp, etc. These types of jobs are not usually like co-op work terms in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <il><p>Most of these summer jobs are relatively well structured with clear tasks and expectations - this not so with work terms where you will be tasked with something and told ‘figure it out’.</p></il>
        <il><p>Summer jobs do not typically have tasks or deliverables that change during the term or change after being set - work term jobs can have a wide assortment of deliverables during the term and they can change after being given, without notice or guidance.</p></il>
        <il><p>Summer jobs do not often have status reports or status updates expected weekly.</p></il>
        <il><p>The summer jobs are not often cumulative, where on a co-op job you might something (for days or weeks) as part of a bigger picture that others will then use or rely upon.</p></il>
        <il><p>The summer job expectations and work have clear time start/end’s whereas work terms can see a student join an ongoing task, needing to learn what has been going on, what is going on, and what will go on during and after their engagement.</p></il>
        <p><il>The co-op work is probably more project based, could be repetitive, but most likely a specific task or mini-project needs to be done - you might need to figure out what needs to be done on  your own, develop a plan and present this to the ‘boss’ for approval; and then provide updates and tracking on the task.</il></p>
        <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598679253544-2c97992403ea?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MjN8fGZhc3QlMjBmb29kfGVufDB8fDB8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=60" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:300px;height:300px;border-color: #9D6DCE; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
        <p><il>The hiring process for a co-op job is different and why you are hired is different to some degree. In later years, there is a ‘try before you buy’ strategy for senior students and for juniors, it might be helping with vacation time, doing exploratory work or side tasks while the full-timers are on the main task path.</il></p>
        <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560249951-67f7a21fbd98?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTR8fHBlb3BsZSUyMHdvcmtpbmd8ZW58MHx8MHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=60" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #9D6DCE; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>

        <il><p>Often work term tasks for junior and intermediate students are assisting or helping full time staff on different projects or activities and you are not the main person doing the cooking, serving, tutoring, coaching, selling, per se.</p></il>
        <il><p>Because the work often has a degree of uncertainty, the bosses expect some level of initiative, ability to figure it out, know what question to ask, know when to ask a question and when not to. They do not want to be surprised and they expect you to own any mistake that is your fault and that you are directly accountable, responsible for.</p></il>
        <il><p>On a work term, the employers expect professional and appropriate behaviour that is mature, mindful, responsible, and accountable.</p></il>


        <il>
            <p>
                The co-op employers will expect professional emails and conduct on the job and when interacting with others - in person or through electronic media.
                They will usually get quite upset if you do social media or personal email etc., while on the job - to the point of having official policies which could result in you being terminated.
            </p>
        </il>
        <p><il>Often work term employers will expect you to do your own work and they will not want to do it for you. That is why you were hired. If they are going to do your work for you, why are you hired? You cannot get away with ‘make work’ and ‘look like you are busy’ type activities in most cases - there are solid deliverables that they are expecting you to work on.</il></p>
