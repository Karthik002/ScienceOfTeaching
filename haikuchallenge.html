                              A visitor to the site has inspired us. They summarized some of the pages in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku">haiku</a> form and shared with us.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              If you are so inclined, please feel free to write some relevant haiku poems summarizing the material and we will add some to the webpages. If we get enough, we will swap poems in and out during the year (we will have one or two per page). Of course, you can expect us to be a bit picky as well - not all submissions might appear!
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              We are also looking for orginal student artwork that matches the theme for each page. We would like to get rid of all of the photos over time! As above, if we get enough submissions, we will swap out and we will be picky about the style etc. fitting with the website design - not all submissions will be used.

                          </p>
                          <p>
                              Send submissions to kmckay at uwaterloo.ca clearly indicating what page the haiku/art is for, that it is original, that you are the creator/owner, that you have the right to share, and that you are giving us specific permission us to use it for this website. If you do not say all of this, we cannot use your work.
                              If you want, we will give you 'credit' on the page where used - your option. It can also be anon. Indicate your choice - anon or credited. For fun, you can also specify what Uni, program you are in (or HS if that is the case).

                          </p>
