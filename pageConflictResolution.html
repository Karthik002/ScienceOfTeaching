    <h1> Conflict resolution - making peace and sorting it out</h1>


    <p>
        Hopefully you will have a work term or internship where there is no conflict, but it can happen that you have conflict with your boss, your boss's boss, a peer of your boss's, one of your peers, or someone you are supervising or directing.
        You need to understand why the conflict arose and how to avoid similar situations in the future if possible.
        But, you also need to fix the situation, minimize the potential damage, and figure out how to move on.
        Note, we are talking about the typical, normal types of conflicts that can occur. If there is any harrassment, abuse, or stuff that crosses the line, you should know the company's policies and ways of dealing with it, and you should also be aware of the resources provided by the university.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are some questions to think about. For example,
        <ul>
    <p><il> You need to think about the factors and what the situation is. Are there outside factors? If so, who has control of them? Figure out who set the policy, rule, or expectation. Figure out who should be engaged and who is simply a messenger or bystander. You want to work with the right people to resolve the conflict.</il></p>
    <p>
        <il>
            What is involved? For example, does the situation deal with perceptions, actions? Honesty? Good faith? Loyalty? Dependability? Accountability? Quality? Productivity? Who is involved and who is impacted?
        </il>
    </p>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>Our top suggestions</h1>
    <ul>
        <p>Understand where the other party is coming from. Use “I understand” statements.</p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not get defensive and tear the other person down.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>Create a safe space where the other party can voice their opinion and allow them to frame their argument without blaming them or shutting them down. </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not point fingers and blame the other person or other people who are not directly involved in the situation. Do not do the conflict resolution in a public forum or space.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>Actively listen to the other person explaining their side. You maybe have misinterpreted their intention and maybe the ‘conflict’ was just a simple misunderstanding. </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not cut the other person off and interrupt them.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>
        <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551836022-d5d88e9218df?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8NHx8aGFwcHklMjBtZWV0aW5nfGVufDB8fDB8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=60" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #4373C0; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>

        <p>
            Use “I” statements. For example, reframe your message in a way that it is not about what the other person is doing wrong but about how you feel you might be doing right.
            Or, you can start off assuming that you might have miscommunicated something, or that you did something that led to the conflict. It does not hurt to take the high road and hold yourself accountable for at least part of the problem.
            You should also leave room in the discussion where you might actually be wrong, and you need to compromise or change your mind.
            You do not want to paint yourself into a corner, or force yourself to the cliff edge where you have no ability to back down or compromise.
            These types of positioning can make the other person feel less attacked and make the
            argument framed more around communication, mutual understanding, emotions, opinions, personal beliefs rather than a personal attack on the other person. You never want to make it a personal attack!
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not use “You” statements. This can further escalate a conflict as it will sound like you are attacking the other person and things you don’t like about them.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Maintain a calm tone and a level head to think rationally about the best outcome solution. Take time later or before the meeting to process your emotions so that you are prepared to find a solution and move forward at the agreed upon meeting.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not raise your voice, get angry, or upset and lose control of your emotions.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Show a willingness to compromise and collaborate to reach the best outcome solution.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not hang onto your pride and your grip on your argument. This will likely result in a lose-lose situation.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            When making recommendations, leave the person a way out, it is merely a suggestion that does not need to be followed.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not give a ‘should’ or 'must' condition.

            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Maintain the privacy of the other person involved, if you need to vent, consider journaling or talking to someone with no ties to the person involved and keep their name anonymous. This ensures the privacy of the person is maintained.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not talk behind people’s backs. This will violate the person’s privacy and this should never be done anyway.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Take the lesson from the conflict, reflect, learn and grow.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not take it personally. The conflict is over a situation, it is not a personal attack on you or your values.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Pay close attention to what’s not said. Notice posture, gestures, facial expressions and how they are different from their words. Create an environment where a person is more comfortable being honest with you.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not ignore nonverbal communication.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Prioritize conflict resolution over being right. Sometimes it is better to say sorry, admit that you’re ‘wrong’ even when you don’t think you are. Take the blame and allow the other party to save face. Making this sacrifice can pay off later when the connection is maintained, and the channels of communication remain open.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not be stubborn and let your pride stop you from moving on and making amends with the opposing party.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Focus on current conflict, the way forward and not looking back on already resolved previous conflicts.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not merge together past conflicts and develop a bias against the party. There may not be a pattern, the conflicts may be unrelated.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>
