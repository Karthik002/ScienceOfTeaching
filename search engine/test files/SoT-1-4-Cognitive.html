    <ul>
        <p>
            According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a cognitive skill: <i>of, relating to, being, or involving conscious intellectual activity (such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering).</i>
            Everyone thinks, reasons through their actions, and remembers; from babies to the elderly everyone exhibits these to some degree.
            These basic skills are related to meta-level skills such as planning, problem-solving and designing.
            In a professional program, we want these basic and meta- skills to be at a high level of performance: able to understand and practice the discipline in an effective and efficient fashion.
            What is needed to develop this higher level of performance?
        </p>
        <p>
            Just because you might have done something once, or perhaps a few times does not mean that you are an expert.
            There is also confusion about the process of doing something and the final outcome; it is possible to produce something that looks good by accident!
        </p>
    </ul>

    <h1>Insights...</h1>
    <p>The skill and expertise literature from Cognitive Science/Psychology provides the insights, knowledge and methods we need to leverage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            There is the recognition that cognitive skills exist at different levels of development – from the naïve, novice, junior, intermediate, senior, journeyman, consultant/expert, and master. Depending on the literature, you will find six-seven levels of development and each has certain traits and characteristics.

        </li>

        <li>

            Junior thinkers (naïve, novice, junior) will ‘think’ differently from the senior thinkers. It is not linear and it is possible for some of the cognitive skills to outpace the others. For example, someone can be very good at remembering and memorization and exhibit senior level performance... but still be operating at the novice level when problem solving, planning, and designing.

        </li>

        <li>

            The research has shown that most cognitive meta-skills like problem-solving and planning do not transfer between domains and situations; that is - just because you can manage X does not mean you can manage Y without some additional learning and skill development.

        </li>

        <li>

            There is the concept of deliberate practice that is required if someone wants to improve; to reach a true expert level will require in the range of 10,000 hours of deliberate practice. You do not improve just by ‘doing’. You need to be more intentional, reflective, deliberate about improving and what it is you want to improve and why.

        </li>

        <li>

            A typical course has about 144 hours of student ‘learning’ (lectures, assignments, labs, tutorials, studying, etc.). If the topic is largely isolated without multiple lectures building up the knowledge and skills, the students will just be entering the novice level of expertise at term end. If there is a good design of complementary topics during a program, it is probably possible to consider that the student might be at the junior level. Definitely no higher unless they have had exceptional internships, co-op terms, or mentoring during their program. They may think that they are experts or have mastered the topic, this is a delusion.

        <li>

            There are self-perception problems associated with cognitive skills (basic and meta); there is over confidence and the lack of self-awareness.

        </li>
        <li>

            You can improve some muscle memory and habituation aspects of automaticity without deliberate practice. You can also make some of the cognitive skills quicker in response, but these will not be necessarily ‘better’ in quality. Doing things faster is not always better in quality nor does it always demonstrate improvement.

        </li>

        <li>

            True experts are aware of what they do and don’t do. They know what they don’t know. They understand the limitations of their knowledge.
            There is tacit knowledge and processes in play; automaticity and habituation of a sort.
            If asked, an expert usually describes the process as they were taught, not how they do it. In a series of case studies, highly qualified individuals were observed doing their daily tasks for two weeks and approximately 10-15% of the performed tasks were identified as ‘I did not do that’.
            Experts are not always consciously aware of what they do and do not do (McKay 1987).

        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Most instructors do not appear to consciously consider the cognitive skills associated with the course material and assessments.
        They dismiss the skills; not as difficult or as valuable as the topic they are teaching.
        They make assumptions about incoming skill levels and how cognitive skills are developed: “Students learn by doing”, “Students have worked in teams before”, “Students have done design tasks in other courses”, “Students should know this by now”.
        The science says otherwise! The cognitive skills required by a course need to be consciously developed prior to the course and high levels will not develop otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other observations...
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            Do not assume that skills and their level will remain the same term-to-term. It is important to re-test every offering.


        </li>
        <li>

            The students must see value in the skill and see differences in skill levels; in some cases they need to be humbled (a bit) to deal with the over confidence they come in with.

        </li>
        <li>

            The students must eventually be able to look at any process and ‘see’ the cognitive skills in play (basic and meta); there are different skills needed to identify a problem or opportunity, figure out the importance or impact of the problem or opportunity, requirements that will address the problem or opportunity, potential solutions, determining which solution to proceed with, actual solution design (detailed level), implementation, testing, deployment, maintaining, etc. There are different types of problem-solving, design, analysis, and planning throughout the design  process and it will be rare for a single individual to be well skilled in all. The students will need to understand the different roles, different skills, and understand how they all relate by graduation!

        </li>
        <li>

            It is difficult (almost impossible) to focus on a cognitive skill while learning something else at the same time. You have to progress into it – junior students will have a very hard time learning TWO things at once and it is often possible to overlook the skill learning component.
            Carefully choose the cognitive skills you want your students to learn as to not overwhelm them.

        </li>
