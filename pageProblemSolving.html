    <h1>Problem solving - journeys of the mind</h1>
    <ul>
        <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1566669437687-7040a6926753?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1867&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #CC628F; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
        <p>
            Problem solving is a cognitive skill and is pervasive. You are constantly trying to figure out what to do, how to do it,
            why to do it, when to do it, where it should be done, and who might do it. There is casual, informal problem solving
            and there is the professional type of problem solving. Some problems will take minutes and others may take weeks
            or months to crack. If you want to be better than others, you need to consciously think about your problem solving
            skills and methods. <b>You need to deliberately practice problem solving.</b> You also need to be aware of possible biases
            and issues when you think (Kahneman 2013).
        </p>
    </ul>
    <h1>Approaching, understanding a problem</h1>
    <ul>
        <p>
            Perhaps the first challenge is understanding the problem - comprehension is necessary before you can apply
            knowledge, analyse the problem, synthesize a solution, and evaluate it. John Dewey once noted that a problem well
            defined is a problem half solved. <b>Think three times, cut once…</b>
        </p>
    </ul>
    <h1>Things to consider</h1>


    <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1539627831859-a911cf04d3cd?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1951&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #C65162; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
    <ul>
        <il>
            <p>
                First, try to take it all in - the context, the situation, the various moving parts, people, system and
                understand at a high level. One trick is to imagine explaining the situation to a three year old. This is like
                seeing the mountains and water and taking in the scene, wallowing in the majesty of the view. <b>
                    Squint, blur
                    the vision - see the big picture.
                </b> Caution: do not over do the analysis to the point of paralysis.
            </p>
        </il>
        <il>
            <p>
                Second, you try to identify and isolate the various components - what they are, how they relate to each
                other, what value does each bring, what are the issues with each. You understand what is core to the
                problem, and what is superficial or irrelevant. This is like looking at the mountains and water, but not seeing
                it as a whole - you are seeing the trees in the forest, not comprehending it as a forest. You do not see the
                mountains and water as one. In this phase, you can create simple visual models or sketches of what is
                ‘happening’ (how are things connected, what does the situation look like from start to end. <b>
                    Try a dull sketch
                    in sand with a blunt stick.
                </b>
            </p>
        </il>
        <il>
            <p>
                Third, and this is the part that is hard to explain, if you understand it well, you will get to the point of seeing the mountains and water as one again.
                This is the aha, eureka, OMG moment of understanding the situation, when it all comes together. <b>Summarize the zen - what makes it what it is and no more.</b>
            </p>
        </il>
    </ul>
    <h1>Drilling down</h1>
    <ul>
        <p>
            How long does this take? How much effort? If the problem to solve is in your wheelhouse as they say, it can take
            minutes to ‘see’ the situation and understand it. If you have not worked in the topic before, it can take many months
            to get a real handle on something that is complex. Do not rush this. <b>Understand what you are dealing with.</b> See
            Gause and Weinberg (1990) for more about problem solving, identifying the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            In doing this, you will usually get a better understanding of what the REAL problem is. Not the symptoms someone
            might be confused by. You will usually get a better understanding of what questions should be asked, and not
            necessarily what was asked. <b>Know the REAL problem.</b> Root cause analysis: ask <b> WHY five times! </b> It really works.
        </p>



        <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1488203602058-8db2ce840718?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #CC628F; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
        <p>
            Solving a problem implies that you eventually get to a solution. In Management Engineering, you will learn lots of
            methods and tools. These are what you will use to deal with the specifics after you understand what you have to do.
            There will likely be multiple solutions as well - each with pros and cons. <b>
                Know and understand the implications and
                limitations of using various tools, not just how to use them.
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            You need to know the assumptions and conditions that the method relies on. You need to know when to use a tool
            and when not to. Someone might ask you to use a method they have heard about, not really understanding the
            method and you need to deal with this. You need to understand the weaknesses and strengths of the methods, else
            you can create a bigger problem. <b>Choose the right tool based on the actual context.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            You need to understand enough about the problem to know how well the situation fits the tool and sometimes you
            can say ‘x is kinda similar to y, and z can work on y, so it is reasonable to try z on x’. If you do this, you have to be
            careful and let people know you are possibly pushing a tool, possibly creating a risk. <b>State the assumptions and risks.</b>
