    <h1> Hearing what you need to be told - not what you want to hear: evaluations and feedback</h1>

    <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589307904488-7d60ff29c975?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Mnx8anVkZ2V8ZW58MHx8MHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=60" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:600px;border-color: #68C8CA; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>

    <p>
        You might have weekly or bi-weekly meetings with the 'boss', or not. During these meetings you might get feedback, or not. You will usually get a mid-term evaluation and an end-of-term evaluation. Some companies have formal eval processes as well. Some don't. Tis a mixed bag.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are things you can and should do before a semi-formal or formal evaluation, and you should probably do a self-evaluation monthly as part of your reflections. Your employer/supervisor might also ask for you to do a self-evaluation in advance and submit it before the evaluation meeting.
        When doing your self-evaluations, it is important to be honest, be self-aware, and think using a growth mindset, use a continuous improvement approach to yourself. It does not hurt to admit to mistakes and oopsies. What you need to do is understand the cause of the mistake and have a plan for how to avoid.
    </p>

    <h1>
        Prior to getting feedback (pre-midterm eval)
    </h1><p>
        <ul>
    <p>
        <il>
            Are you taking control of your actions prior to them impacting your term? i.e. thinking through your actions and how they will affect others and their perception of you.
            Remember that some people’s perceptions are their reality. Ensure that your intentions are good and clear to minimize any loss in ‘translation’.
        </il>
    </p>
    <p> <il>When you go to your boss – do you explain the situation, what you did, plan A/ plan B?</il></p>
    <p> <il>Avoid only talking about obstacles/problems. Discuss what is good, kicking butt! But, if you think there is an issue: </il></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
    <p>
        <il>Why do you think it’s a problem? Do you know the history behind this challenge? Did you investigate what the company did before? What worked/didn’t work? Why the previous solutions failed/succeeded?</il>
    </p>
    <p>
        <il>What did you do to try to figure out the challenge?</il>
    </p>
    <p>
        <il>Do you have any potential solutions? Make sure you have thought through your solution to ensure their soundness before proposing them. </il>
    </p>
    <p>
        <il>A sound solution is one that is safe, doesn’t degrade product/service quality, has a reasonable/justifiable cost, is efficient (if applicable).</il>
    </p>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p> <il>Don’t expect the boss to do your work for you. They are not there to hold your hand; they are there to supervise you and ensure you are getting your part done to the standard of quality the organization requires. In some cases, they will provide mentorship, but you are not entitled to that.</il></p>
    <p> <il>If totally lost, Google, call a friend, or seek a mentor in the organization if possible. But remember, respect confidential agreements, proprietary company data, etc. - be careful what you share!</il></p>
    <p> <il>Try avoiding going in and not having a good starting point. Think about it first before going to the boss.</il></p>

    </ul>

    <p>
        <ul>
    <p> <il>Are you clear on the feedback received? If not, did you clarify what do is meant by x? Are there any examples provided by your boss?</il></p>
    <p> <il>Did you ask, ‘when I did x, was that what you're referring to?’</il></p>
    <p> <il>Did you ask for examples of a time where you did x?</il></p>
    <p> <il>Did you ask, ‘if I did y, would that be an improvement?’</il></p>
    <p> <il>Did you ask, ‘what does improvement in x look like?’</il></p>
    <p>
        <il>
            Continue clarifying by asking questions to further break it down until absolutely clear on the root cause of the area of improvement.
            Then do your research and try to grow in your opportunity areas. Read articles, ask coworkers, mentors and friends. For ex, ‘how did you become more resourceful?’
