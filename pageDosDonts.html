    <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1585336671611-84c832187eab?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTN8fG9rYXl8ZW58MHx8MHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=60" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #68C8CA; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>


    <p>
        Here is a short list of what to do on the job and what you should think twice about doing! If you do any of the don’ts – do damage control.  Don’t be defensive when criticized, just listen, suck it up and let it go, don’t get into a fire fight.
    </p>


    <h1>Our top suggestions</h1>

    <ul>

        <p>Think first before doing something, or copying someone else's behaviour.</p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not do something just because someone else is - that will not be an excuse - just because you can do something, does not mean you should. Always try to demonstrate 'what should be done', and reasonable judgement.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>Come to meetings on time, perhaps 1-2 minutes early.</p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not come to meetings late. If it happens, apologize and explain the delay and make sure that it does not happen again.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>
        <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1582893523614-76d5069711f8?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8NHx8ZG9uJ3R8ZW58MHx8MHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=60" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #68C8CA; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>


        <p>Come to work on time, perhaps 10-15 minutes early to get ready, prep. </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not come to work late or just as the clock hits the time - come to work prepared to actually start working when the day starts.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>Dress appropriately. Look around and observe what 'most' people wear - not other students, not the extreme individuals who are trying to stand out based on how they look, dress. </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not dress in a way that makes others at work question your judgement.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Be courteous and know your manners - be a giver and not a taker, thank people when they help you, and be willing to help people when they need help, but be careful of still doing a good job on your stuff first.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not use intimate, 'familiar' phrases, street slang,and definitely do not use any vulgar, improper words like swearing on any documents or in meetings (can be a fireable offense).
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Communicate professionally, formally.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not be informal with your boss. The boss isn't a friend/sibling/family member.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Understand the value of your coworkers and boss’ time. Appreciate their help/mentorship etc.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not feel entitled that others have to help you/spend their time on you.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Build credibility by showing that you can get your part done.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not claim credit for things you haven’t done, or assume that others will fix things for you, or that others will do your work for you.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Make friends with peers, other team members, build professional relationships, get to know your coworkers.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not gossip, be a part of cliques, add fuel to the fire, just say “I don’t know about that, I haven’t seen that”.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Have something to take notes on in meetings if you are participant and be prepared if you are leading the meeting.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not go to a meeting unprepared, especially if you are playing a leading role or hope to have your ideas heard. Spend some time thinking about the issues, what risks exist, what options can be thought about, what is the bottomline, and what are some ideas for the next step.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Speak to people in private if you want to investigate.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not call people out if you think something was their responsibility and they didn’t do it/ didn’t do it properly.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            If you have to go to a new area for a meeting, check it out first so that you know where you are going, how long it will take.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not get lost going to an important meeting. This is not good.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Pay attention in meetings, look like you're interested, display engagement, ask for clarification when appropriate and if unclear.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not Look bored, start completing other tasks, zoning off, looking around, having side conversations.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Be open to constructive criticism. Stop, internalize, learn the key lesson, reflect and grow.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not take it personally, cry or complain to other coworkers about feedback that you received. This doesn’t show maturity.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Only use your phone for work related things like if you need to text a boss/co-worker for communication, if you are allowed.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not be on social media during work; especially on work computers during work time.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Know your place, understand accountability and responsibility. Your boss is accountable for your ideas so their call/decision/opinion matters more than yours.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not assume you know everything, what the problem is, what the solution should be with only a limited amount of time spent on the topic, in the situation – often things are more complicated than you know and it is best to stay quiet until you know enough to have a well thought out comment.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>


        <p>
            Be humble. Have a “gotta do what you gotta do” kind of attitude. No task is too small, and no challenge is too big. Give it your best shot. Display the desire to help but understand the limitations of your knowledge and experience.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not say or have the attitude that “I am too good to do this”. Don’t be a know it all, overconfident based on no demonstrated results. Don’t act like you know more than your boss.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Understand that your boss’ opinion is what holds, if you can't persuade based on facts, then the boss' opinion is what matters, it is not a democracy, not everything can be voted on.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <il>
                    Do not go around your boss without trying to work it out with them first.
                </il>
            </p>
        </ol>
