    <ul>
        <p>
            In theory, teaching is one of the expectations of almost all post-secondary education institutions.
            This institutional organization is the system that you plug into, that is what you are becoming a part of. Some things you may not have control over but others you might.
            This section will provide an overview of educational institutions took a management sciences approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a balanced scorecard (ASQ Balanced Scorecard, Kaplan and Norton 1992) approach is used for the institution, teaching would be one of the top, strategic objectives, along with research.
            Depending on strengths, competitive advantages, and other strategic goals, there can be other items on the balanced scorecard.
            The trick is to have relatively few and then have all of the operating units within the organization aligned and moving together based on the balanced scorecard. A cascading balanced scorecard approach can be used throughout the organization, where each, more granular, scorecard is matched and driven by the one(s) above.
            Significant or substantial efforts should align with the goals and objectives; why they are done.
            The concept of mission focused management is what is behind the balanced scorecard and ‘good’ strategic planning.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is the mission? Set appropriate standards for the goals. Figure out what it takes to go from the current state to the desired state.
            Complete and execute the tasks required by the ‘mission’.
            The mission steers the organization and helps set the priorities, where resources will be allocated and what activities will be undertaken.
            It is possible to have more than one mission, but it is not wise to have more than two or three and only if you can clearly articulate and execute; dealing with conflicts between mission demands.
            Compromises are not pretty.
            It is usually not possible to have equally valued missions and one needs to be the priority and weights are used; hence the concept of a balanced scorecard.
            The technique helps identify the proportions of the organization’s assets used or directed toward each ‘mission’.
        </p>

    </ul>

    <h1>What would it look like if a mission focused management perspective is taken toward teaching?</h1>
    <p>Some thoughts are...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            There would be a dedicated, VP or Assoc. Provost for Teaching. Perhaps even a VP for Quality.

        </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li>

                This role would not be part of a larger portfolio, but a single mission. Just as many institutions have a VP or Assoc. Provost for Research, teaching on campus should be important enough to warrant someone’s full time attention.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>

            A two-pronged strategy would exist for high quality teaching (to the level desired by the institution).

        </li>
        <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565073624497-7144969d0a07?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=334&q=800px;" style="float:right;width:300px;height:400px;border-color: #4373C0; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>

        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li>

                For the ‘how’ and the ‘what’. Well stated goals and definitions are needed to set expectations of both instructors and students.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>

            It is often assumed that faculty members know how to plan and design curriculum, to conduct reviews and make changes. Why? What courses and training have they had in these cognitive skills?

        </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li>

                Short courses and guidance should be mandated to faculty members on these topics, as well as quality management principles which are relevant. Quality methods do not restrict innovation and freedom per se; however, they can set minimum standards, expectations, and avoid less than desired quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                The majority of instructors are not trained in process evaluations and analysis. A small team of process evaluation experts would be available on campus to help departments and programs do the ‘big’ program and curriculum reviews.
            </li>
            <li>
                The average faculty member is not trained or experienced with continuous improvement, change management, risk management, or implementation science. A centralized resource would exist to help departments and programs plan and manage change.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li>

            Department and program level resources.

        </li>

        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li>

                There would be an appropriately trained teaching resource individual per department or program. Their job would be to work with instructors on yearly or bi-annual reviews of teaching and assessment methods, course design, etc. There are enough courses in a program that if serious, sincere reviews are undertaken, the individual will be busy.
            </li>
            <li>
                There would be an appropriately trained resource within the department or program to help with the actual mechanics of course preparation and materials when a course gets a major overall, re-design.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each department would have an Assoc. Chair for Teaching with some voice and influence with respect to yearly reviews and teaching practice.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>

            Centralized resources.

        </li>

        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li>

                There would be one or more of what was once called ‘flying squadrons’ of course preparation experts that would work as a team out of a central resource, loaned and dedicated to help with major program or course re-designs.
                These individuals and teams would be multi-skilled and not assigned other conflicting tasks.
                They would be able to focus and dedicate their efforts to the task at hand. Time would be given between assignments for other tasks, learning, etc.
            </li>

            <li>

                Sufficient resources would also be available to support peer-review and course evaluations; the outside arm’s length perspective.

            </li>
        </ul>
