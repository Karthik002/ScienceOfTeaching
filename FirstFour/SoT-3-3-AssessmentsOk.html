                If you are teaching a foundation course, make sure to check in on your students throughout the term and monitor their progress;
                know if they are ready and capable of doing the final you are planning.
            </li>
            <li class="takeaway">
                Help students with back up plans in case they mess up a big final - it should not be an all or nothing situation.
            </li>
            <li class="takeaway">
                Watching students grow and learn during the term can be rewarding, and you can do this with multiple assessments and then have a smaller 'final' - e.g., 20-25%.

        <p>
            There are some courses and subjects where things start off from scratch almost and it is not toward the end of term where sufficient material has been taught that the pieces can come together in an aggregated fashion. Until enough has been learned, it can be hard to assess mastery. Often these types of courses are in the first two years of university; the years spent creating the foundation. The third and fourth years are sometimes viewed to be the levels where the concepts are applied, explored, and more deeply understood.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have one of these types of foundational courses with a big learning curve, read on.

    <h1>Suggestions...</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>


            The very nature of the course and material means that weighted assessments will occur at the end of the course.  Explain this to the students. Embrace it, work with it.
        </li>

        <li>
            Toward the end of the term, stop teaching new material and focus more on practicing, understanding what has been taught. This might be the last two weeks of the course. That is ok. Stop the fountain of new knowledge and skills. Create some confidence if you can, help the students understand what they do not understand.
        </li>

        <li>
            You need to support this concept during the term to monitor progress, give nudges, etc. so that a student who could master the material can be successful. (and those who cannot, will not).
        </li>
        <li>
            The assessments can and probably probe both individual concepts, but also the integration and inter-relationships between the topics. The assessment should explore the dynamics, dependencies, and co-dependencies if possible.
        </li>

        <li>
            We strongly suggest multiple touch points and monitoring through the term to identify
            those engaged, those not engaged, those at risk, those not. The at-risk students
            should have interventions before the final. If the student is not engaging based on
            their own judgement, or because of other activities, so be it. However, if the
            student is not engaged because of factors you might be able to affect, it is wise and appropriate to help the student (with modern online teaching platforms, it is often possible
            to know if a student is engaged, and you can perhaps reach out, encourage, nudge the student in various ways).
        </li>
        <li>
            If a student has in fact a bad day and just blows the test because of stress or other health reasons, it is important to have a parachute.
        </li>

        <li>
            If you have a rule about minimums (e.g., if you get less than 35% on the final, that is your final mark, regardless) you need to make this clear from the start of term, provide support and help along the journey, monitor, and connect with the students. The fear  and structure should not negatively impact the student. There should be a mechanism whereby a student is doing good during the term, doing the work themselves, not cheating, has a bad day, and is not punished. It is possible to have such a process, but it takes thought and mindfulness.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set the standards where they should be and have good reasons for doing so. Have supports and monitoring where you need them. This is where the format of instruction is important. It is relatively easy to know what student knows what if you attend and participate in the labs, tutorials, etc. If you do not, you might be able to rely on great TAs. Really knowing what each student knows and can do during the term is hard with live-streaming and almost impossible to do via asynchronous video formats. You need a high level of interaction if you are going to do a great job monitoring, tracking and understanding what might happen on a big final.
        </li>

        <li>
            Do not punish who are doing the right stuff and then have a bad day. Do not reward those who take advantage of others during the term and then just punt on the final knowing that they will pass on the group effort. It is a delicate balance and it takes proactive management and effort to get right. Assuming that a ‘good’ student can talk with you, figure it out, and then write a make-up exam the next term is not a great solution. It causes WAY too much stress and extra work!
        </li>
        <li>
            If you support the students along the way, you can have the joy of watching a student going from not being able to do something to being able to do something on the summative final. That is a big thrill and makes teaching worthwhile.
        </li>
