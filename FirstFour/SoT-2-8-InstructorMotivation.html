                Instructors need to be intrinsically motivated to be better at teaching, to do what is 'right'; sadly there is often no real reward or external motivation from the institution.
            </li>
            <li class="takeaway">
                Make sure you know how you are motivated and seek this out (i.e. finding like-minded colleagues, getting feedback frequently, etc.).
            </li>
            <li class="takeaway">
                Understand what your department offers for getting better at teaching, then leverage this.

            Instructors need to be motivated if they are to engage and do what ‘good instructors’ should do. Without motivation they will go through the paces, be there in body, but not in spirit or mentally. In some cases, they will not be there in body either.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instructor motivation is an intriguing and interesting challenge. There are lots of myths and misconceptions. We have found that a mixed, hybrid approach has worked best.
        </p>
        <p>
            And yes, this is the same intro as the one used for student motivation. Motivation is motivation and instructors have the same issues with respect to doing more than just ‘good enuf’. Unlike students who get multiple, granular assessments for each course, for each term, cumulating with progression through a program toward a degree - instructors exist in a different feedback and reward mechanism.

    <h1>Reflections...</h1>
    <p>
        It is possible, depending on the department, faculty, and institution that ‘good’ instruction will go unnoticed and unrewarded.
        It will depend on how much teaching is valued and understood.
        It will depend on what the department and others define as good instruction and how it is measured.
        Watching other instructors be rewarded for mediocre instruction while emphasizing other activities such as research will be de-motivating (e.g.,  Zimmerman 2020).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            If you are in a neutral situation, it will be hard to be motivated.
        </li>
        <li>
            It might be easier to be motivated if you have a buddy or a mentor; someone to discuss plans, results with.
        </li>
        <li>
            A regular group meeting of teaching enthusiasts (not just a passion for teaching, but a passion to learn about learning theory, cognitive skill acquisition, etc.) can be motivating.
        </li>
        <li>
            Observing and helping another instructor can be motivating.
        </li>
        <li>
            There will often be hurtful and negative comments in evaluations and it is important to reflect on them, but not take them personal. It is important to sort out political or personal agendas from appropriate feedback given in an awkward fashion.
        </li>
        <li>
            Voluntary and random feedback from past students can be highly motivational; if it is going to happen, it will. It cannot be generated or contrived.
        </li>
        <li>
            One can seek motivation from class dynamics and student interaction; lecture to lecture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Observers can give constructive criticism, encouraging words, and this can be a motivating factor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Working with experts from the institution’s Teaching Center can be motivating.
        </li>
        <li>
            Being an innovator and doing the extra effort needed to improve your teaching might earn you the distinction of being an outlier (Wagner). Awareness of the dynamics that often go with being an outlier can possibly help with the de-motivating aspects.
        </li>
        <li>
            Self-motivation is important if you are going to go for best practice. Sadly, many instructors are ok with average practice or just good enough practice. Some are ok with even less (and why not? There's no external consequences usually). It is best to ignore what others are doing and what others are being rewarded for.
        </li>
        <li>
            Departments can motivate instructors by recognizing appropriate pedagogy and skill and provide rewards along the lines of course relieve, support to attend teaching workshops, conferences (outside of your home institution).
        </li>
