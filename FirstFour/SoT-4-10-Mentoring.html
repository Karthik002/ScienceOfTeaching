            This section is about mentoring others. There is a separate section on being mentored.
        </p>
        <p>
            This section focuses on the concept of mentoring that is similar to how one advises their PhD students. However, it is important to note that our definition of mentoring is not solely limited to mentoring grad students. There are many great professors who mentor not only their grad students, but also undergrads.
        </p>
        <p>
            If one searches on the word mentor, a phrase is often repeated, linking the word back to the Odyssey by Homer: a loyal adviser of Odysseus entrusted with the care and education of Telemachus. Think about what this implies. First, mentoring is a long-term relationship, not a few weeks or a few months. Second, it includes an element of providing some level of care beyond the purely academic.  Third, it is about educating and teaching the student how to fish, and not rely on always being given the fish. It is not simply answering questions during office hours, or giving one or two bits of advice several times a year.
        </p>
        <p>
            We view mentoring as a major commitment – in the beginning it is usually weekly or at least bi-weekly meetings. A mentor situation is not quarterly or yearly. It is not ad hoc. It is not strictly reactive. Mentoring is proactive with a plan and strategy for how to work with the mentoree. The word mentoring is often over-used and someone often called a mentor is not really a full-blown mentor – perhaps a white belt mentor versus a black belt. This section is about serious mentoring – the black belt variety. It is also possible to do a minor mentoring role, a green or orange belt – some contact once a month or every two months.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the mentor might talk about themselves on occasion for the purpose of illustration or in normal social chitchat, the focus of mentoring is not the mentor. It is the mentoree.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not everyone can be a mentor. And, not everyone can be mentored. There must also be a trust relationship and credibility factor between the mentor and mentoree. The mentoree must be open to constructive criticism, coaching and prodding with respect to deliberate practice, and be willing to take leaps of faith. On the opposite side, the mentor must be able to give constructive criticism, coach and prod where necessary, and be able to create discomfort at times.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mentor is often asked to give career advice, and at times asked to weigh in on personal advice as well – as the relationship grows. This is a delicate balance and the mentor must know and respect the boundaries associated with the mentoree. Each situation will be different. The mentoree might also push boundaries and the mentor needs to be able to gently and firmly establish and maintain the boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
            A mentor role is a long-term commitment and can exist over decades. It should not be entered into lightly. That being said, it is also sometimes necessary to sever a relationship, wean someone off the mentoring dependency, arrange a succession plan with an alternate mentor, or negotiate a ‘divorce’.
        </p>
        <p>
            Assume that a black-belt level of intensity mentor-mentoree relationship will be 1-2 hours each week – between emails and face-to-face meetings. There will be times where 3-4 hours in a week will be necessary, weekends, middle of the night, but these should be relatively rare.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mentoring is not just solving problems or giving advice. As a teacher, the mentor must look for ways that the mentoree can grow, and the mentor must be an active teacher and coach.

    <h1> Thoughts… </h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Usually, the mentoree makes the first move – asking the mentor to be their mentor. But sometimes, you will see someone worth mentoring. And, if you do, go for it.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you do not have the capacity, do not engage. You should not do a half-hearted job as a mentor. It is not fair to the mentoree.
        </li>
        <li>
            Agree to a trial arrangement – see if you can relate, work together – see if you can mentor and if the prospective mentoree can be mentored.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set up a regular time every term for a meet – can be coffee or lunch oriented, or a more regular type meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
            Try to keep most of these meetings – they are important.
        </li>
        <li>
            As a mentor, keep mental notes about personal aspects as they help with relationships and establishing the trust. For example, remember to ask about the new puppy, what the kids are doing, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            Try to listen and think about what the person is saying and not what you want to say when it is your turn – it is not about how smart or wise you can make yourself appear.
        </li>
        <li>
            When necessary, be prepared to be blunt and to the point – identify the problem in the room and give honest feedback, without emotional baggage.
        </li>
        <li>
            When trying to sort out options, let the mentoree lead the discussion, think about pros, cons, risks, options. Ask the mentoree to reason through the options and see the strengths and weaknesses. The role of the mentor should be to help the mentoree learn how to fish for themselves, not to always deliver the fish on the platter.
        </li>
        <li>
            During some sessions, be happy with chit chat. Some sessions need to be 100% neutral.
        </li>
        <li>
            For the most part, work with anything that the mentoree wants to talk about first, and then revisit past discussions if you feel that the mentoree is avoiding something or not giving enough information.
        </li>
        <li>
            You want to make sure that you emphasize reflection, deliberate practice, in the discussions (see separate notes on each of these).
        </li>
        <li>
            The mentor must know what they do not know and not cross the boundary – they must be aware of hubris and self-praise. If you do not know, say so and this can create a situation where the mentor and mentoree can learn together.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h1> Co-dependencies & The Necessary and Hopefully Sufficient </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The mentor must know when to speak and when to listen. Often, the mentoree just needs someone to talk to, not to get actual advice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sometimes no advice is the best advice. Sometimes a Socratic approach is necessary and it is best if the mentoree is led to an epiphany that they self-realize.
        </li>
        <li>
            The mentor must not give into the mentoree whenever the mentoree whines or declares defeat. If the mentor honestly believes that the mentoree can figure it out or do it, the mentor must find a way to lead the mentoree forward; even if the mentoree is not 100% happy with the process.
        </li>
        <li>
            The mentor must try not to judge (at least on the personal or personal value bits) – one can judge on outcomes, but care is needed on issues related to self-esteem and the like.
        </li>
        <li>
            The mentor must have a thick skin and sometimes be the brunt of venting and emotional outbursts. The mentor must be able to shake it off, respond in a level way, and not take it personally.
        </li>
        <li>
            The mentor must never expect anything in return themselves – even a thank you. Remember, it is not about the mentor. We will always inform the mentoree in the beginning that nothing is expected – except for the expectation that – when they can help someone else, they should REALLY consider it – something like a scene from The Godfather.
        </li>
        <li>
            The mentor must always remember that they are mentoring and are not the focus of the activity. The mentoree cannot be expected to remember anything or to behave in a certain way. The mentor has to keep the process in a positive place.
        </li>
        <li>
            The mentor must know what they do not know and not cross the boundary – they must be aware of hubris and self-praise. If you do not know, say so and this can create a situation where the mentor and mentoree can learn together.
        </li>
        <li>
            The mentor is in a position of trust and must be the ‘adult’ in the room. The mentor is not always nice, and sometimes has to give tough love – with care and fairness, but say what must be said, not what the mentoree wants to hear.
        </li>
        <li>
            A mentoree might have multiple mentors – different skills, dimensions – and the mentors must respect other mentors and their expertise and direction.
        </li>
    </ul>
