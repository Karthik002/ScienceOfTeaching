                You are a student's TEACHER not their FRIEND. Remember this relationship because you don't need students to like you in order to be a good teacher.
                We're social creatures and WANT to be liked, but that doesn't make you a good instructor.

                Watch out for the edutainment trap (especially when you know that this often is tied to good course evals, but bad learning). Not doing this does NOT mean your course has to be boring - there are many ways to make a course interesting.

                Enjoyment and fun are not needed for learning (they can help with motivation, but not actual learning). Look to other strategies to make learning stick.

            We are the students’ instructors and teachers, not their buddy or best-friend-forever. Sometimes you have to be the parent and the adult. We are responsible for creating a situation in which they will learn and hopefully retain the learning.
            Too often, student evaluations of a course are a popularity contest with all of the trappings and issues.
            In some cases, instructors implicitly or explicitly realize this and teach to the evaluations without really worrying about real learning or quality. We consider this form of pandering to be unprofessional and a dereliction of duty.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have observed superb instructors receive amazingly low student evaluations, and less than admirable instructors receive high evaluations repeatedly and be rewarded unjustly.
            The amount of imbalance depends on how much emphasis the respective departments, faculties, and institutions place on the student instrument. The issues with student evaluations are discussed in a separate note (LINK) .
        </p>
        <p>
            We have listened to top students complain about the edutainment instructors who present fantastic classroom experiences with high engagement and where students enjoy attending class, but where the students are not sure what they have learned and are not aware of any lasting learning.

        <li>

            It is possible to create an interesting class situation without falling into the edutainment trap.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is not written anywhere we have seen that courses must be dull, boring, monotonous, and non-engaging.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drama, narrative, and relevant examples are an excellent way to get learning to stick; if it is done in a way that complements the learning outcomes, is reflected upon, and explicitly linked to the outcomes and used in the assessments.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is nothing in cognitive science that says you have to enjoy somethin g to learn something; it depends on how the learning is done, the value associated with it, and if the learning is ‘strong’ enough to stick. Enjoyment relates to motivation to attend and to possibly engage, but the actual learning is not driven by the smiley face.
        </li>
        <li>
            Students and instructors are often confused about the role of enjoyment and fun in learning. Enjoyment and fun can make the time go quicker and can help with the dopamine rush. This is not learning.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the instructor is insecure about retention or promotion and the student evaluations are weighted improperly, it is human nature for many of these instructors to figure out what the students like and do not like. Do not be surprised if sessional, contract, and junior instructors learn this and practice it. In certain departments, it is wise to make the students happy and turn a blind eye to their actual learning (sadly).
        </li>
        <li>
            The 1956 report that Bloom co-edited explicitly discusses what the students will like and how easy it is for an instructor to take the easy way out.
            If an instructor actually follows the recommendations in the report for teaching and assessing above the knowledge level, the authors predicted that instructors will find that it takes more effort and the majority of students will not be happy.
            Taking the easy way out is a subtheme in Zimmerman’s  "The Amateur Hour" (2020).
        </li>
        <li>
            The dull and boring classroom can be improved. It is possible to create suspense and the sense of the unexpected each week. This can be woven into activities and how the material is presented. There can be drama and theatre when doing narratives, reflecting, doing think-pair-share, constructive failure, cases, peer instruction, etc. All of these methods create opportunity to create moments. Simply writing on the board material from the text rarely does. Social connections with learning is a great tool!
        </li>
        <li>
            Take some serious speech lessons, learn to communicate, use body language, do improv, etc. Have people watch, critique. Get feedback from the class reps; are you doing it and getting the effect you want, are you doing too much of it, etc. – read your audience, understand the results of the enhanced delivery.
        </li>
        <li>
            Involve the class in the event and have them participate. This will help with making the memory and lesson stick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not take yourself seriously. Do not live in an alternate universe where you think that your topic and lesson is special, the most important one in the program or the world and that it must be a sober and hallowed experience.
        </li>

        <li>
            Do NOT do the drama and entertaining all of the time, and in very lecture or situation. Use it for effect, to make a point, to create imagery for the student, a lasting memory. If you do it all of the time, it will not be special, and the students will become desensitized. It cannot be routine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remember, it is not about you, it is about how the drama and the moment helps the student learn and retain the learning.
        </li>
        <li>
            Never, ever, just entertain for the sake of showing off, being cute, trying to be cool. The students deserve better. Any ‘entertainment’ should be deliberate and strongly linked to outcomes and the students should be aware of this and understand the linkages.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not assume that the students can see the link between the moment and the learning for themselves. They might need to be told how it relates and why you are doing the drama, the special effects.
        </li>
