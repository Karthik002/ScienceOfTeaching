            This is one of those topics that can get quite heated at the water cooler. There are times that ‘no’ final is ok. There are times where a final of about 25% is warranted.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are also times, rare that they are, that a final of 40-50% can be justified. We will deal with this category in a separate note because there are lots of moving parts to deal with. If you can justify the big FINAL and do the additional work that comes with it, then it is ok.
            If you just do the big FINAL without other necessary and sufficient conditions being satisfied, shame on you (see the next note on 'Ok' final assessments to see our list!).
        </p>
        <p>
            The FINAL is sometimes contentious because of differing pedagogical belief structures, but there are also times where FINALs are conducted with no valid justification or rationalization related to pedagogy and assessing mastery of a subject.
            Where FINALs are abused, it might be because the instructor has not really thought about it; they have inherited a course, they are assessing the way they were assessed, they are assessing the way that others are assessing.
            Perhaps they just do not know that other forms are possible and should be considered. Perhaps they do not realize that they are doing something that does not make sense?
        </p>
        <p>
            The FINAL exam format might also be a culture thing or officially enshrined at the department or faculty level; for example, all courses must have a 50% final. We have seen good policies and practices and we have seen some practices that made us pull our hair out.

    <h1>Thoughts...</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>

            There are foundational courses where the course starts at almost zero and builds during the term and it is important to assess the summary knowledge and understanding at the end of term.
            Depending on the learning outcomes, it might be possible to assess during the term, but there are some courses where something like a 40-50% final actually makes sense (see the next note on 'Ok' finals).
        </li>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557001755-c09547e21d90?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2850&q=800px;" style="align:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #9DD9E0; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick; margin-top: 5%">

        <li>
            We do not think that a 40-50% final makes sense for courses with cognitive complexity outcomes such as comprehension, non-textbook problem solving, ill-structured problems, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating.
        </li>
        <li>
            Courses which are akin to a design studio or seminar course are not good candidates for a big final in our opinion.
        </li>
        <li>
            Courses which are cognitively based should have sufficient assessments during the term to track, monitor, and assess student progress. A summative assessment probing how much a student actually learned and retained is a valid reason for a final of around 25%.
        </li>
        <li>
            A final assessment of about 20-25% can be useful for an individual cross-check on mastery (especially in courses with many group activities. In this case, you can focus on understanding, interpreting, and reflecting which is not based on memorization. You can use this assessment to also reflect upon what each student might have contributed to a team lab, project, or assignment. It can be very useful intel.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is also possible to do the above point without a final. It is sometimes feasible to create an individual, unique project or activity that allows the individual’s flame to burn bright (or not). It is possible to assess mastery without a final. It depends on the course and the instructor’s skill with assessments.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are doing a final, perhaps the best model is the open book style where the students do not need to worry about memorizing the obvious and trivia and can focus on more substantive learning; and learning where to find material quickly if need be.
        </li>
        <li>
            We are not a big fan of ‘cheat sheets’. We once used them. We admit it. That was before we moved to open book style assessments and focused less on the regurgitation and drill and focused on actual learning. Cheat sheets in theory help those who cannot memorize, but at times they seem a cruel joke; with students trying to cram in as much as possible into the given space. So much stress, unnecessary effort; on top of a misplaced focus. Has nothing to do with learning and demonstrating mastery  .
        </li>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518133910546-b6c2fb7d79e3?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=975&q=800px;" style="align:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #9DD9E0; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick; margin-top: 5%">
        <li>
            Big FINALs, winner take all, when the course and learning outcomes are not appropriate:
        </li>
        <li>
            Big FINALs just because they are less work to create, less effort to execute during the term, easier to mark, and so forth are NOT warranted or justified.
        </li>
        <li>
            Big FINALs just because it was too much effort to create robust assessments during the term (or perhaps not knowing how to) is not a reason either.
        </li>
        <li>
            A big FINAL without appropriate consideration of learning and assessment theory can help create the necessary curves and mark distribution, but this does not mean that the exam was fair and that all students had a chance to fairly and equitably demonstrate their mastery of the material.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is nothing from Neuroscience, Cognitive Science, learning, or assessment that supports a single, large, assessment without other supporting mechanisms (see the next note on 'Ok' finals).
        </li>
        <li>
            Often, instructors create magical formulations that dynamically reduce the weight  of the final (or increase it) based on performance.
            They use these incantations as a way to excuse the FINAL weighting and the issues related with it. We view this as making the best with what you have, versus re-designing and creating an assessment approach that does not need the witches’ brew and howling at the moon. The approach does not help with mental stress or the actual ability to demonstrate mastery. It might make the instructor feel good and some of the students feel better, but there is not a pedagogical leg to stand on.
        </li>
        <li>
            Note: upon graduation or on internships, the students will not have to demonstrate their mastery in such a contrived way and there are multiple opportunities and ways post-graduation to demonstrate mastery. Assuming that mastery demonstrated on a three-hour final exam translates to mastery upon graduation or in a later course is a stretch. It is not plausible.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Tips for Beginners</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Find out what your department policies are. Some require a written final with a minimum weighting. As the new instructor, now is probably not the time to challenge it (flawed as it may be).
        </li>
        <li>
            Be kind to yourself. If you inherit a course, you may want to teach it the first time the way it has been taught in the past. This will give you a good feeling for where students struggle, what is actually essential and how you can better support their success and learning on the next offering.
        </li>
