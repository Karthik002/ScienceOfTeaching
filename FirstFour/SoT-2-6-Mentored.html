                There is a lot of value in being mentored, especially as a junior instructor. This requires a clear understanding in the mentee-mentor relationship and mutual respect.

            <li class="takeaway">
                Even mentors can make mistakes; make sure your mentor is actually an expert in what you want to be mentored in, and then actually use their advice.

            <li class="takeaway">
                Watch for common pitfalls in making a judgement call too quickly when it comes to teaching practices (i.e. if you've never done it before, don't agree,
                don't see immediate change, have a different opinion, etc. -- all of these doesn't mean it's wrong)

            This section is about being mentored. If you want to learn about mentoring others, there is a different note (LINK).
        </p>
        <p>
            You must want to be mentored, not just because you have heard that it is a good thing to be mentored. You must want to be mentored by the mentor, not just because the person has been assigned or offered – there must be a value-added component.
            Assuming that the mentor is at least average and is invested in mentoring the mentee, the mentor is committed to investing in the mentee and also sees value.
            The mentor must also feel that the mentoring is worthwhile, and value is derived. There can be formal mentor-mentee relationships and there can also be very organic mentorships. Either option can work well.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is short term mentoring that helps someone get through a specific situation or crisis, and there is long term mentoring that literally goes on for years and even decades. We are talking about the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being mentored does not mean that there is a major problem or issue with the mentee. Someone can be mentored because they are self-aware and want to keep moving forward, improving.
            Unfortunately, some people view being mentored as a stigma, they believe that they need to show the world that they are so smart and omniscience that they do not need a mentor, or that they can get the necessary guidance from their peers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Often there is an age gap between the mentor and mentee, does not have to be, but does seem to occur. The premise is that the mentor has been on similar quests, down the same road, learned a few things and developed ‘wisdom’.
            This takes time. It takes time to go through an experience and it takes multiple experiences to develop wisdom.
            There are reasons why wisdom is usually associated with the ancients. The mentee must value this wisdom and while not all advice or thoughts need be followed or tried, the majority should be.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are times the mentee will just want to chat about day-to-day thinking and choices. There are times that the topics will be more intense. There will be times that the mentor wants to raise a topic or issue. The mentor should have a good idea about where the mentee has been, where they are now, and what the future journey might look like. The mentor will try to help the mentee toward their goals, but this might not always be fun or valued in the moment.
        </p>

    <h1>How to be a successful mentee...</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>

            The mentee needs to have clear understanding why they are seeking mentorship.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reasonable and feasible expectations of a mentor need to be set – the mentor will not know everything or have wisdom about everything, and they will be wrong at times. Even mentoring requires learning and experience!
        </li>
        <li>
            Boundaries should be set – if there are topics which will be off limits, everyone needs to know them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Research the mentor – are they really experienced in the topics you are seeking mentoring in?
        </li>
        <li>
            Talk to current and past mentees (if you can) – can you deal with the mentor’s style or mentoring? It might not be for you.
        </li>
        <li>
            Establish a regular routine of face-to-face meetings – weekly or bi-weekly. If it is a major mentoring relationship, this frequency is needed. If it is more of an occasional relationship that might still last years, every month or so will do. Regardless, there should be regular coffee chats or discussions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Negotiate a trial relationship with no-fault terms for exit. It should not be assumed that the chemistry will work, and this is really no one’s fault. It should be easy to walk away if there is no value or the effort is too painful.
        </li>
        <li>
            Try to keep in mind what the mentor might know (or not) and what they are sharing (or not). Not all mentors do it, but the good mentors will try to ‘teach you how to fish’, or even ‘how to create your own fishing kit out of nothing’, and then how to use it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remember that for the mentor to do this requires careful control over knowledge and what is instructed and what is self-learned. Failures provide the best learning and it is important to be in the right philosophical zone or thought space to benefit from this style. It is easy to forget or overlook why the mentor is saying, suggesting, or doing.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a mentoring session, reflect what has been experienced and learned since the last session. Reflect on past guidance and advice – what has been used or not – in the interim. If the advice was relevant and worked, why? If the advice was relevant and did not work, why? If the advice was not relevant why? If the advice was not used, why?
        </li>
        <li>
            Think and talk about what might be on the horizon for the next 2-4-6-8 weeks and what choices or decisions you might need to make. Discuss these in advance, think them through with the mentor.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Co-dependencies & The Necessary and Hopefully Sufficient</h1>
    <p>
        The mentee must also be open to share their challenges and issues. The mentor cannot read minds or guess everything.
    </p>
    <p>
        There must be a trust and value relationship between the mentee and mentor. The mentee needs to have a growth mindset and be open for advice – they have to believe in and trust the mentor in some way.
        They must respect the advice of the mentor and be willing to take the occasional “leap of faith” as the mentor pushes the mentee. In short, reflect on the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            Just because <i><b>you do not understand it</i></b>  does not mean it is wrong, nor that it will not work.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just because <i><b>you do not like it </i></b> or enjoy it does not mean that it is wrong, nor that it will not work.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just because <i><b>you have not done it before</i></b> or used it before does not mean that it is wrong, nor that it will not work.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just because<b><i> others do not do it </i></b> or advocate for it, does not mean that it is wrong, nor that it will not work.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just because <b><i>others do not consider it best practice</i></b>, does not mean that it is wrong or a worse practice, nor that it will not work, nor that it might not actually be better practice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just because <b><i> it is is not obvious to you</i></b>,  does not mean that it is wrong, nor that it will not work.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just because <b><i>you do not see value in it</i></b>  and think that it is a waste of time, does not mean that there is no value, nor that it is a waste of time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just because <b><i>you do not agree with it</i></b>  and think that there is a better way does not mean that it is wrong, nor that it will not work.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just because <b><i>you do not have facts to regurgitate</i></b>  does not mean that you have not learned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just because <b><i>you do not see immediate results</i></b> does not mean that changes in you have not been made and that results will not appear in the future – perhaps only seen in hindsight and perhaps without you being consciously aware of it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just because <b><i>you do not generally believe in it</i></b> in it, does not mean that others do not, nor that it is wrong, nor that it should not be done.
        </li>
