            There are several forms of instructors working together. There are the multiple section model where multiple instructors are teaching in-sync across multiple sections, 
            sometimes using a common syllabus and common assessments. That is a good topic, but not this one. This co-teaching note is about when two or more instructors work together on the same course!
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on observations, there are three possible outcomes: it goes great, kinda neutral ho-hum, or it goes south, chalk and cheese, oil and water, pure oxygen and a lit match.
        </p>
        <p>
            This note describes how to make things smooth and how to leverage each instructor’s contribution and potential.

    <h1>Thoughts...</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>

            There needs to be the ability to compromise on both parties’ part. It is possible that one might be more senior or have more experience with the course, but an open mind is necessary for all, including the senior instructor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just like every team situation, each team member needs to invest time to know the other teammates. This means that you need to understand what methods and approaches the other is comfortable with, has experience with.
        </li>
        <li>
            You need to figure out the learning objectives and make sure that both REALLY understand what they imply. There might be an existing course the two (or more) are taking over, or one is joining the other. Either way, everyone needs to understand the learning objectives.
        </li>
        <li>
            There needs to be a common view about assessments, assessment feedback. Consistency will be important.
        </li>
        <li>
            Messaging and interactions with the class need to be discussed and a strategy, plan in place before the term starts. It cannot be two parents being played off one-against-the-other by the kids. The team must speak as one on almost all policies and interpretation the same.
        </li>
        <li>
            The delivery style needs to be discussed and it must be planned what role each will have, what each will do. There must be a coherent flow and an equal level of quality across the two instructors. This might mean that one might have to help the other and the one being helped must be open to being helped.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each instructor can have personal and unique methods. That is ok. It is just a matter of having it all planned out so that there is nothing contradictory or confusing going on. E.g., if both are flipping, the same flipping style should be used. A mix is actually good, but it should be like a well choreographed dance recital and not a bumper car derby at the fall fair.
        </li>
        <li>
            Be willing to compromise the first year and to slowly work it out. It will take time. Do not expect everything to be smooth the first offering. Do not expect to get your own way all of the time.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the course is an existing one and you are joining as the new team’ee, you should follow the basic principles outlined in the note about taking over a course. 
            Do not make rash moves, best to keep thoughts to yourself until you have a worthy thought, and you should invest time in understanding the situation before jumping to conclusions and making recommendations and seat-of-the-pants observations. Measure twice, cut once. There is room to discuss, but be careful about opinions versus experience and wisdom. Of course, you might be entering a situation that needs fixing, but give it time and develop a healthy relationship first.
        </li>
        <li>
            The work should be broken up equally and fairly. Neither should ‘just phone it in’.
        </li>
        <li>
            No one should make arbitrary decisions and say ‘this is the way it is’.
        </li>
        <li>
            Both instructors have to play together in the sandbox and make an effort at it. One might be teaching what the other wants to teach or thinks that they can teach better. If it is close enuf, suck it up. One might want to create a certain assessment or take the lead on a specific topic. If it is close enuf, let it go. If both do this, it will work out. Both need to be givers, not takers.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is a mini-course review (at least it should be) when two people start to co-teach a course. It is not an insignificant investment or commitment to do it well . 
            Hours and days need to be spent – what is taught, why, what methods to instruct with, how to assess, who will do what. What is perceived to have gone well? What warrants attention? 
            We would expect 2-3 weeks working together on the course design and preparation to do this well. That assumes an open mind for all involved, and that the 2-3 weeks is not spent arguing!
        </li>
        <li>
            Last thought, the team needs to think through the above and not take things for granted, nor make assumptions. If you do not talk, discuss, plan and sort things out in advance, things will not go well. It will be duck and cover time.
        </li>

    <h1>Tips for Beginners</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The level of course development and re-work you do the first time you co-teach the course will depend on your teaching partners level of experience with the course. If they have taught it many times, you may need to just tag along for the first offering and start taking a more active role in making changes to the course in future offerings.
