                Outliers in teaching are innovators (including those who use innovations from other experts) who go against
                the local norms in post-secondary education; innovations which are usually unrewarded and are not initially valued by institutions AND students.
            </li>
            <li class="takeaway">
                Failure in teaching/course improvement is part of the process BUT failure is only okay when the right checks and balances are in place to manage risk and the mistakes are not repeated. Failure because of sloppy thinking is not ok.
            </li>
            <li class="takeaway">
                Instructors should own any 'predictable' risks and failures associated with the innovations. If the change has been reviewed by qualified experts and sanctioned, the instructor should not be hung out to dry; rather, they should be rewarded.

            In “Creating Innovators: The Making of Young People Who Will Change The World” (2012), Dr. Tony Wagner used the term outlier to describe teachers in the primary and secondary school system who were innovative and trying to teach the students to be more creative and successful problem-solvers. Perhaps relative or temporal innovation is a better phrase because, as noted by Zimmerman in “The Amateur Hour” (2020), almost everything we think to be “innovative” in teaching today has been advocated and done in the past by the few who dared.
        </p>
        <p>
            We think that the term outlier also applies to certain instructors in the post-secondary space.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outliers seem to be self-motivated. They appear to have a passion for working with students and achieving the learning outcomes above Bloom’s knowledge level.
            Even in the Bloom report from 1956, the authors noted that i) <b>few instructors will put in the effort to teach above the knowledge level</b>, ii) <b>few students will want to be taught above this level</b>,  and iii) that <b>institutions for the most part would not care either</b>. It was easier for all; focus on facts, basic interpretation in a structured, well-defined way, memorize facts, recite recipes, and regurgitate algorithms, be able to do text-book problems.
            Bloom and his colleagues noted how hard it would be to teach and assess for understanding and comprehension, and to be able to actually use the knowledge.
            However, this does not stop outliers. Outliers will interpret, invent (or possibly re-invent) and work toward a higher quality of learning.

    <h1>Some observations...</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>

            Not all innovations and innovators are created equal
        </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">

            <li>
                Some outliers and innovators are hacks and do not think it through or understand what they are doing. These individuals do not innovate based on science or evidence, but on whim and whimsy. Sometimes it is about them, their egos, and not the students (See section 2.8)
            </li>
            <li>
                Others care, are trying to do something good.  They might have good intentions BUT the innovation is poorly done.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some will use the innovation as an excuse when things go south and will not hold themselves accountable for poor decision making. “It was a good idea at the time” excuse.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <li>
            Innovations are rarely done  using best practice for change management and risk management, even though this should be done every. single. time.
        </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">

            <li>
                No checks and balances. No quality controls or potential risk mitigation strategy in place. The innovation has not been discussed and vetted by others with expertise or experience with the innovation or similar innovation. Innovations should be done with controlled risk and with pre-acknowledged sanctioning by those with oversight.
            </li>
            <li>
                If things go south, there needs to be plans and options in place. If an instructor makes a mistake, the instructor should eat it and not pass the downside onto the students.
            </li>

        </ul>


        <li>
            ‘Junior’ outliers are at high risk
        </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">

            <li>
                If the junior instructor does not have tenure or a power base, the instructor needs to be careful about what kinds of innovations to introduce, when to introduce them, and how to introduce them. (Ellis 2013).
            </li>
            <li>
                If not managed, the students will be likely to be grumpy and upset. They will view the instructor as using them as an experiment and, while students might like to think of their institution/faculty/department/courses as innovation, it is not on their watch. And grumpy students will be vocal about any and all mishaps during the term. This is not ‘good’ for a junior instructor.
            </li>

        </ul>



        <li>
            Outlier evaluation
        </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">

            <li>
                The yearly performance reviews are based on the norms and by definition, outliers are not the norm. What they do, how they do it, etc. are not typically picked up via any standard, one-size-fits-all review process. Few review processes include categories or mechanisms that address change and improvements. The majority of instructors might be happy with the status quo because it works for them. It will not work for an outlier.
            </li>

        </ul>




        <li>
            Supporting outliers
        </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">

            <li>
                It is sometimes possible to get support from the department to do innovation. Based on our experience and observations, the support and help is well-intentioned, but rarely is sufficient or long-term enough. Solid evidence and results will not usually happen in one term or one year.
            </li>
            <li>
                The changes need to be slowly and carefully made, with multiple pieces coming together over several offerings. It is not like the stock market with day trading or quarterly results. It is a long-term strategy and investment program. Is the funding sufficient for long enough to enable success, or is it too little and too short and guarantees failure?
            </li>
            <li>
                Major innovations need to be paced, and during a significant effort it is unlikely that the instructor will be able to do everything else they are supposed to do. Is there back filling? Are other expectations adjusted?
            </li>

        </ul>




        <li>
            Innovation success

        <ul style="list-style-type:none">

            <li>
                Failing, making mistakes is good if they contribute to organizational knowledge, damage is contained, and there is good root cause analysis done. It is like a thesis topic. What if the student’s ideas do not work? Is it still a thesis if it contributes to the body of knowledge and advances the field? We think so. Ad hoc flailing is not to be rewarded, neither are initiatives that are clearly ill-advised, not feasible or reasonable by any normal standard.
