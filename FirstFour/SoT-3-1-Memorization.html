                Be aware that not every teaching style works for every student. Try to have a mix of the different styles so students don’t feel alienated, and have a fair chance at learning.

            Memorizing means that you have committed ‘something to memory’, learnt by heart, with the intent of later recall when the ‘something’ is to be used in comprehending, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating. The idea is that you can recognize, recall and use useful, other knowledge related to what you have memorized. The thing memorized can be a trigger for other internal or external knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the higher education level, students are often asked to memorize many different types of things. Krathwohl categorizes knowledge into four types: factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive (D.R. Kathwohl (2002)).
        </p>
        <p>
            There are some things you need to remember and there are other things that you do not. In the latter case, we are reminded of an observation made by Peter Drucker – <b><i>there is nothing more futile than doing something efficiently that should not be done at all</i></b>  (Drucker 1963). If you can look it up when you need to, when you need to apply, analyze, synthesize, and evaluate, why place a great deal of emphasis on memorization during a course?
        </p>
        <p>
            So, not every piece of knowledge has the same utility or value in the cognitive process. Some knowledge you should have at your fingertips, instant recall. At times, different levels of knowledge are necessary and it is not always possible or desirable to start from first principles all of the time.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <h1>
        In a specific field, you should have:
    </h1>


    <ul>
        <li>

            Instant recall of the foundational principles and concepts, know any pertinent traits, characteristics that you would encounter regularly and frequently.

        </li>
        <li>

            The ability to understand a discussion, recognize the basic assumptions being made, and what their implications are.

        </li>
        <li>

            Knowledge that these theories and concepts exist and where to look if you need to spend more time on them.

        </li>
        <li>

            Knowledge and understanding of the dependencies and co-dependencies between the common and most important theories and concepts.

        </li>
    </ul>


    </ul>

    <h1>Thoughts...</h1>
    <p>
        An instructor should be selective about what knowledge is taught and expected to be retained after the course (not just till after the final exam), and how it can be learned and retained. Although, we know from the predictions made by Bloom and his colleagues that many instructors will find lots of facts and basic knowledge to teach and then assess; it does make the job easier if you do not have to muck about with understanding and comprehension.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            Use the principle of Threshold Concepts   to vet your syllabus and assessments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Replace non-threshold content with examples, comprehension, applications, and understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
            Provide resources and have the students use them with respect to the threshold concepts; they need to know that such resources exist, how to find them, how to use them, and to experience the value the resources can provide. It is not sufficient to just provide URL’s or references. This is a key part of the learning to learn. They will learn this by doing, not being lectured at.
        </li>
        <li>
            Replace simple recognition, regurgitation assessments with assessments that give the students a chance to demonstrate comprehension and understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
            Avoid multiple choice unless you are also giving feedback on how the answer is reached, the underlying knowledge and mastery that led to the answer. Yes, it is easier to mark if you do not do this extra work, but it is not about you.
        </li>

        <li>
            Some students cannot memorize lists of meaningless phrases and words. Just cannot. Period.
            Done like toast. Finito. It is at the Cognitive Science level and we cannot wish it away or to change - it is how the brain is wired. For those with this issue,
            it does not matter how many hours are spent, how many times something is written, repeated, or stared at. Not going to happen.
            But, this does not mean that they cannot learn the material and demonstrate mastery of the key
            concepts and theories as well as the students who can memorize.
            They just need a different path to the prize.  Not being able to remember things does not mean that they are unintelligent. We know from personal
            experience that the inability to memorize will not prevent one from
            learning at a high level, and becoming a University professor; we just had to learn differently and eventually the knowledge was 'there', in memory.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some students need to understand and then it will stick. Some students need to have a narrative or scenario to create the context for recall and comprehension. It is possible that students who need to remember via such means actually remember it better! Do you allow for different styles of remembering and understanding, or do you exploit these issues to create your bell curves?
        </li>
        <li>
            If you want to learn more about making things stick, there is a good book on it (Brown 2014).

    <h1>Tips for Beginners</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You may need to teach a course once before you can get a good handle on what does and does require memorization.
        </li>
        <li>
            The internet provides a wealth of knowledge at our finger tips. Many things that were essential to memorize even 10 years ago are now readily available in seconds. If memorization isn’t essential, consider providing the information when the internet isn’t accessible, such as during a written exam.
