                A good instructor must also consider equity and inclusion as part of their teaching style. Not all learners are the same, which means they need different things.

            <li class="takeaway">
                Think about EDI (equity, diversity, and inclusion) in your course design, continuous improvement, student interactions, learning support, etc.
            </li>
            <li class="takeaway">
                Equity and equality aren't the same thing - students deserve equity in their learning which does NOT mean every student has to be taught the exact same way.

            When teaching, you need to think about the students and how you engage and treat them.
            All students are <b>equal</b> in terms of human rights and equally deserving of respect .
            In that regard, you should consciously reflect on what you do and how you do it to ensure that you treat people fairly.
            <b> Equity  </b> is about recognizing individual circumstance and allocating resources and opportunities so that an equal outcome can be achieved.
            You also want to make sure that you do not accidentally or implicitly create situations that provide inequal access to opportunities and resources for those with physical or mental disabilities, or based on gender, race, class, etc.; this is what <b>
                inclusivity
            </b> is about.
            It can be tricky to do all of this and it is likely that some of the students will not be happy about what they are experiencing or what they observe others to be experiencing.
            Ill-placed entitlement can also creep in, be disguised, lie just beneath the surface, and these situations must also be managed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The student experience is important, and instructors must remember that they are in a position of authority, trust, and that the power equation is not balanced.
            We must remember that it is possible to accidentally marginalize or say something or do something that is not appropriate.
            The rules seem to constantly change and today’s generation (as a whole) has been brought up in a coddled fashion
            (Lukianoff, Haidt 2019).
            We cannot change this and we need to deal with it.
            We hope that no instructor intentionally says or acts in a hurtful or marginalizing way!
            We can lead by example and help students understand such issues and learn how to deal with situations which might cause them discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not likely that someone can go through life without being in a situation that accidentally  - and without intent  - makes them feel uncomfortable or makes someone else feel uncomfortable.
            Individuals have different comfort levels and that makes it challenging. When possible, we can help explain to students how to handle accidental and unintentional situations versus those which are intentional.
            In the first case, the situation can be looked upon as an opportunity to repair the harm, and to educate and inform with understanding and empathy (e.g., reformation, restorative justice approach).
            In the latter case, well, that is different and intentional 'bad' practice needs to be dealt with by those in authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the context of a course, these concepts play out in different and numerous ways. For example, <b>equality</b> implies that the course grading and assessments be designed that for the most part, all students have an equal starting point in the
            course and that the instructor is assessing what was taught in the course or explicitly linked to a previous course. This is the equal starting point. Marks are not given for skill and expertise not associated with the course. This gives everyone
            an equal chance to demonstrate their learning. <b>Equity</b> implies that we support and facilitate the opportunity for students to reach the point of demonstrating mastery in different ways; one size does not fit all. For example,
            memorization should not be the only way mastery is verified.

    <h1>Thoughts...</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>

            Check the time warp factor. What was acceptable in the 70’s, 80’s, 90’s etc., might not be accepted now. This includes words, metaphors, humour, narratives, examples, body language, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            Check for possible bias in the curriculum that makes the content, examples, narrative, or emphasis overly-centric or one-sided (implicitly or explicitly); geographic, race, gender, age, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            Check the cultural factor. What might be acceptable in one culture might not be appropriate in another. As we have discovered with our own second language skills, it is also very easy to accidentally misuse a word or phrase and put your foot in your mouth. Actions are similar.
        </li>
        <li>
            When possible, try to help students understand how to listen and interpret how others are speaking and acting. It might not be intended to be hurtful. Marginalizing actions might not be intentional either.
        </li>
        <li>
            Are the formal policies and explicit practices for the various issues? Not just disability? For race, gender, sexual orientation?
        </li>
        <li>
            Instructors need to understand what universal instructional design means and honour basic human rights – e.g., pronouns are not a preference, they are a human right. Even if you do not care, others will.
        </li>
        <li>
            Student needs and abilities vary widely. Deal with it. Some students will require additional help and special help in order to reach an equal outcome.  Exceptions need to be thoughtfully considered. There is a big difference between equity and equality, have this talk with your students.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are doing a program or course review, are you consciously considering issues of equity, diversity and inclusion? In the material? In examples used? In how the material is shared and presented?
        </li>
        <li>
            Students will be different and students are not necessarily equal when it comes to being a ‘good student’, learning ability, engagement, or learning ‘attitude’. Not every student is fair, nor treats all others fairly and equally. Every student should not expect to get an A just because they are a student, or they turned up, or tried hard. When we teach, we assume that all students have the potential to get an A in the course, even a 100, until proven otherwise. But it is earned, not a right.
        </li>
        <li>
            Be mindful.
        </li>
