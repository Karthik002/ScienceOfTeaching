    <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1527137342181-19aab11a8ee8?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #7196CE; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
    <p>
        This page is formed around student opinions and experiences regarding mental health. This page shouldn’t be used in place of professional services but rather as surface level information on the topic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through a quick search online, you’ll find that mental health is defined as a person’s <b>emotional, psychological, and social well-being</b>.
        As students, we grow to see that life is pretty uncertain and there will be times that you may feel as though you have not lived up to yours or others’ expectations.
        Although this may be the case, it’s fair to say that no one is really 100% ‘ok’, 100% of the time.
        With all the change that we undergo as students and the pressures around us, there will be times where we will be unhappy, sad, bored, anxious, excited, happy, etc. - but this is all natural.
        Sometimes, we need the ‘bad’ days to teach us how to really appreciate the ‘good’ days.
        If we only had good days, everything would feel the same and life wouldn’t be as unique as it is.
        We are also adjusting to different ways of living in the current world situation, which takes a toll and affects everyone differently. Please reach out whenever you need help.
    </p>
    <h1>Listed below are some student insights around mental health</h1>
    <ul>
        <il>
            <p>
                There is normal anxiety and occasionally feeling a little depressed about something. There are clinical categories of anxiety and depression. Sometimes, you may experience a little bit anxiety and should not be worried about it, but if the anxiety is more than momentary, we suggest you talk to someone!
            </p>
        </il>
        <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1564682895970-0dbb72e18d97?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1951&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #358998; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
        <il>
            <p>
                You should know what the resources are on campus and off - weekdays and 24/7. If you think you need accommodation for anxiety, stress, or a learning disorder, deal with it as soon as possible.
                There can be waitlists and if your condition is serious enough to need accommodation, it can take time to set up and arrange. Sometimes it is possible to help you and deal with your issues without formal accommodation! Check out the links to resources below!
            </p>
        </il>


        <il>
            <p>
                As well as campus resources, find out what private health practitioners are covered under your student insurance benefits.
                You may also have dual benefits through one or both of your parents’ insurance benefits.
                Private, off campus Psychologists, Therapists, Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals may alleviate wait times for appointments, with out of pocket expenses being minimal (if any at all), when health benefits are used.
            </p>
        </il>
        <p>
            <il>
                If you have an accessibility issue, try to work with the counsellors etc. to see if there are ways to get better - do not necessarily accept the status quo, or assume that certain issues cannot be dealt with through therapy or practice.
            </il>
        </p>
        <il><p>In today’s world of video games and online worlds, it can be easy for individuals to become socially isolated. These individuals may say things that seem normal online but not in person - know how to tell the difference between 'high drama' and real risks and threats. </p></il>
    </ul>
    <h1>Helping others with mental health</h1>
    <div img="header"> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1499728603263-13726abce5fd?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80" alt="Italian Trulli" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;border-color: #358998; border-style: outset;margin-right:3%;margin-left:3%;border-width: thick;"></div>
    <ul>
        <il>
            <p>
                If you know someone is struggling, try to talk to them, listen to what they have to say, or get them to seek help from others. Avoid piling on myths or saying things that might deter them from trying counselling or other services.
            </p>
        </il>

        <il>
            <p>
                Others interacting with the individual should also be educated about the issues if they are directly impacted, and understand what treatment process is being undertaken and what the implications might be - during the journey and what the outcomes might be.

            </p>
        </il>
    </ul>
    <h1>Counselling</h1>
    <il>
        <p>Just because counselling may not have helped someone else, doesn’t mean it can’t help you - everyone experiences things differently. </p>
    </il>
    <p><il>Do not be off-put from counselling or other services just because you hear there is a waitlist or because you are worried others will judge you, it's always worth giving it a shot.</il></p>
    <p><il>Counsellors are trained professionals that can give guidance, advice, or help you understand what you are feeling. Sometimes, a counsellor might not be the right fit for you. You can also explore mentors, coaches, or even more specialized professionals such as psychologists. </il></p>
    <ul>
        <il>
            <p>
                Coaches and mentors should be able to relate to you, not to judge, but rather to be there to support your goals. They may be friends, family, classmates, or others.

            </p>
        </il>

    </ul>
